# FSJS Project 5 - Public API Requests

## Description:






## Extra xredit features:

The following changes have been made to the styles.css file:
    • font-size (line 34)
    • color (line 36)
    • background (lines 20, 94, 148,197, 258)
    • text-align (line 237)
    • padding (line 92)

An input box and submit button have been dynamically created (using the markup as example) and appended to the '.search-container' div. A keyup event listener searches for (by name) and displays matching employees to screen. Please note, "search" does new send new request to the API, it only searches through results already on the page.
    (lines 42 to 47 and 175 to 197)

Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
There should be no errors once the end or beginning of the list is reached.
Example markup for this feature is included in the HTML comments.
